# Week5-ClassExercise
This is another Java assignment from when I attended the Computer Programming 2 (CS 232) class at Jacksonville State University.
This project is mostly revolved around using the various elements of Object Oriented Progamming. The project itself is jsut a very
simple text based game based on the roleplaying game Disco Elysium. There are a few behaviors from the project that mostly exist to
keep it within the requirements for the assignment. I plan to eventually go back over the assignment and make a few different changes
to polish it up and remove extraneous features that exist purely to keep it within the restraints of the assignment.
